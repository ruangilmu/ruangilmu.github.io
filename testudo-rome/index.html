The concept behind the formation was for the legionaries to form in close order with interlocking shields such that the men were protected from the sides, front, and overhead by a linked wall. The balance of lot of things needs some massive patching. The roman testudo, or tortoise, was a formation widely used by the roman empire most notably during sieges such as that at jerusalem or other walled cities. The problem seeems to be that issuing an attack order breaks the formation, when it should continue to slowly move but with no charge hit.</p>

<p>So i just started playing rome 2 again. In ancient roman warfare, the tortoise formation was a formation used commonly by the roman legions during battles, particularly sieges. Most of the time they relied on their own cavalry. The romans never used the gladius against cavalry either.
